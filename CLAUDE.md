# CLAUDE.md

This file gives Claude Code (claude.ai/code) guidance for working in the VilnaCRM
`website` repository. It complements [`agents.md`](agents.md) (the test-coverage
contract) and the skills under [`.claude/skills/`](.claude/skills). Read both before
changing code.

## Project Overview

VilnaCRM's public marketing website / landing, built on Next.js 16 (pages router) with a
bulletproof-react feature layout. It ships a local Apollo Server GraphQL mock for
development, an interactive Swagger page, and a heavily gated CI pipeline. Everything runs
through Makefile targets; the package manager is pnpm and Docker backs the dev and test
stacks.

## Tech Stack

- Framework: Next.js 16 (pages router), React 19, TypeScript 6.
- UI: MUI 9 (`@mui/material`, `@mui/system`) with Emotion; Storybook 10; Swiper.
- Data: Apollo Client 4 (`@apollo/client`) against an Apollo Server 5 GraphQL mock;
  `graphql`.
- Forms and i18n: react-hook-form; i18next / react-i18next.
- Observability: `@sentry/node` + `@sentry/react`; Next.js web-vitals reporting.
- Tooling: pnpm@10.6.5, Node >=20; Prettier, ESLint (flat config), TypeScript,
  markdownlint, dependency-cruiser.
- Testing: Jest (jsdom + node envs) with React Testing Library; Playwright (chromium,
  firefox, webkit) with Mockoon; Stryker (mutation); K6 (load); memlab (memory);
  Lighthouse CI.

## Mandatory Skill Check (Every Task)

Before any code, doc, or workflow change, every AI agent (Claude Code, Codex, GitHub
Copilot, Cursor, and any other assistant) MUST:

1. Read [`.claude/skills/AI-AGENT-GUIDE.md`](.claude/skills/AI-AGENT-GUIDE.md).
2. Read [`.claude/skills/SKILL-DECISION-GUIDE.md`](.claude/skills/SKILL-DECISION-GUIDE.md).
3. Identify every relevant skill under [`.claude/skills/`](.claude/skills) for the task and
   invoke each match before executing.
4. Apply all relevant skills. Skip one only after recording `Not applicable: <reason>` with
   a concrete justification.

This check is non-negotiable: do not implement, format, lint, test, commit, or push until
the relevant skills have been consulted. BMAD planning skills live separately (see below);
do not mirror them into `.claude/skills`.

## Development

```bash
make start            # Start the dev server (Next.js) via Docker
make sh               # Open a shell in the dev container
make build            # Build the Docker images
make build-out        # Build production artifacts to ./out
make build-analyze    # Build with the bundle analyzer (ANALYZE=true)
make storybook-start  # Run Storybook
make storybook-build  # Build static Storybook
```

Append `CI=1` to run a target on the host without Docker (for example `CI=1 make start`
runs `next dev` directly).

## Testing

```bash
make test-unit-all      # Jest: client (jsdom) + server (node) + edge (node)
make test-unit-client   # Client unit tests (TEST_ENV=client, jsdom)
make test-unit-server   # Apollo server unit tests (TEST_ENV=server, node)
make test-unit-edge     # Edge-script unit tests (TEST_ENV=edge, node; scripts/, 100% per-file)
make test-integration   # Integration layer (TEST_ENV=integration)
make test-e2e           # Playwright E2E (prod stack + Mockoon API mock)
make test-visual        # Playwright visual regression
make test-visual-update # Refresh visual snapshots after a reviewed UI change
make test-mutation      # Stryker mutation testing
make test-bats          # Bats coverage for Makefile / CI shell flows
make test-memory-leak   # memlab leak detection
make load-tests         # K6 load tests (alias: make test-load)
make lighthouse-desktop # Lighthouse audit (desktop)
make lighthouse-mobile  # Lighthouse audit (mobile)
```

Unit suites accept `CI=1` to run on the host without Docker (e.g. `CI=1 make
test-unit-all`). E2E and visual specs run Playwright inside the prod/test compose stack;
E2E uses Mockoon to mock the API. The test-layer map and coverage policy live in
[`agents.md`](agents.md).

### Running a single unit test

```bash
TEST_ENV=client pnpm exec jest src/test/unit/email-validation.test.ts
TEST_ENV=server pnpm exec jest src/test/apollo-server/<spec>.test.ts
```

## Code Quality

```bash
make format     # Prettier (run before lint)
make lint       # lint-next + lint-tsc + lint-md + lint-deps
make lint-next  # ESLint (flat config, eslint.config.mjs)
make lint-tsc   # TypeScript (tsc, no emit)
make lint-md    # markdownlint
make lint-deps  # dependency-cruiser on src, pages, tests
```

Run `make format` before `make lint`; formatting is intentionally separate from the lint
verification suite. Git hooks are managed by Husky. CI phases are mirrored locally by
`make ci-lint`, `make ci-test`, and `make ci` (see the Makefile's CI orchestration
section). Use `make pr-comments PR=<num> FORMAT=<text|json|markdown>` to fetch unresolved
PR review comments.

Never satisfy a gate with `eslint-disable`, `prettier-ignore`, a markdownlint disable, or a
lowered threshold — fix the root cause.

### Code Metrics (rust-code-analysis, issue #224)

Issue #224 introduces a code-complexity gate built on Mozilla rust-code-analysis —
`make lint-metrics`, the policy file `config/metrics-policy.json`, and the CI workflow
`.github/workflows/rust-code-analysis.yml`. This gate is NOT yet present on `main`; the
guidance here applies once #224 lands. The authoritative thresholds live in
`config/metrics-policy.json` and mirror the CRM sister repo's strict budgets; once #224
lands the same policy file is applied by the local target and the CI workflow. Hard metrics
(cyclomatic, cognitive, ABC, argument and exit counts, function and file size, Halstead,
Maintainability Index) will block CI; review-tier metrics are computed but do not.

Do not lower a threshold, exclude a file, or suppress a metric — reduce the complexity
instead. Read the policy file for the current numbers rather than memorizing them, and see
the [`complexity-management`](.claude/skills/complexity-management/SKILL.md) skill for the
refactoring moves (extract helper, lookup map, typed options object, split file, consolidate
exits).

## Continuous Integration (parallel PR pipeline)

Each PR check is its own workflow on its own runner, so they run in parallel and a PR is
gated by the slowest single job, not their sum (issue #316). The layout is
orchestration-only — every check still runs on every PR at the same thresholds; nothing is
tiered off, weakened, or removed.

- **Concurrency.** Every workflow sets a `concurrency` group keyed on the PR/ref. PR checks
  use `cancel-in-progress: true` (a new push cancels the superseded run); the deploy,
  release, and sandbox workflows use `false` so a production trigger is never aborted
  mid-run.
- **Caching.** Node jobs restore the pnpm store (`~/.pnpm-store`, keyed on the Node version
  and `pnpm-lock.yaml`).
- **Matrices.** The Playwright e2e suite splits across a `--shard` matrix
  (`test-e2e-shard`), Lighthouse runs `desktop`/`mobile` in parallel, the K6 load suites run
  in parallel, and mutation testing runs as a shard matrix plus a merge gate.
- **Mutation sharding.** `make test-mutation-shard` (with `MUTATION_SHARD_INDEX` /
  `MUTATION_SHARD_TOTAL`) writes a per-shard report (`stryker.shard.config.mjs`, with
  `break` disabled); `make merge-mutation-reports` unions the shards and re-enforces the
  exact `break` from `stryker.config.mjs` (`scripts/ci/merge-mutation-reports.ts`). The
  split is a total partition, so the merged score equals an unsharded run and the merge job
  fails closed.

## Architecture

The codebase follows a bulletproof-react, feature-based layout.

```bash
src/
├── features/      # Feature slices: landing, swagger, registration, documentation, example
│   └── <feature>/ #   components, api, hooks, helpers, i18n, types, constants, index.ts
├── components/    # Shared UI primitives (ui-* prefix, e.g. ui-button)
├── hooks/         # Shared hooks
├── lib/           # Shared library code
├── providers/     # React context providers
├── shared/        # Cross-cutting shared modules
├── stores/        # Shared client state
├── config/        # App configuration
├── types/         # Shared types
├── utils/         # Shared utilities
└── test/          # Specs: testing-library, unit, apollo-server, e2e, visual, load, memory-leak
```

Key conventions are enforced by dependency-cruiser in
[`.dependency-cruiser.js`](.dependency-cruiser.js) and surfaced by `make lint-deps`:

- Public-API imports: import a feature through its `index.ts` barrel
  (`features-import-via-public-api`); never reach across features by deep path
  (`no-cross-feature-imports`). Shared layers must not import features
  (`no-shared-ui-to-features`, `no-shared-layers-to-features`).
- Naming: directories and files are kebab-case (`src-feature-name-kebab-case`); shared UI
  primitives use the `ui-*` prefix (for example `src/components/ui-button`).
- Also enforced: `no-circular`, `no-orphans`, `feature-allowed-folders`, and the
  not-to-test / not-to-spec / not-to-dev-dep boundaries.

Imports use the `@/*` alias for `src/*` (plus the feature-scoped `@landing/*` and
`@swagger/*` aliases from [`tsconfig.json`](tsconfig.json)); use a relative path for
same-folder imports.

- i18n: per-feature JSON under `src/features/<feature>/i18n/{en,uk}.json` (react-i18next).
  Assert localized strings via the `t()` helper, not hardcoded English.
- Forms: react-hook-form; validation co-locates with its component (for example
  `components/<name>/validations/`) or lives in `helpers`/`hooks`. There is no feature-root
  `validations/` folder.
- Selectors: prefer user-facing semantic queries (`getByRole`, `getByLabelText`,
  `getByAltText`, `getByText`); avoid `data-testid` (guidance in `agents.md`).
- GraphQL: Apollo Server provides a local mock for development; Apollo Client 4 consumes it.

See [`agents.md`](agents.md) for the test-layer map, the test-coverage policy, and the
Faker test-data builders convention.

## BMAD-METHOD Integration

Planning is driven by a local BMAD / bmalph surface (`_bmad/`, `bmalph/`, and the slash
commands under `.claude/commands/`). These are bmalph-generated and local-only (gitignored);
reference them, but keep them separate from the implementation skills in `.claude/skills/`.

Use `/bmalph` to navigate phases and `/bmalph-status` for a quick overview. Common agents:

| Command       | Role / purpose                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `/create-prd` | Product requirements (PM)             |
| `/architect`  | Technical design and architecture     |
| `/sm`         | Sprint planning, status, coordination |
| `/dev`        | Implementation and coding             |
| `/qa`         | Test automation and quality assurance |
